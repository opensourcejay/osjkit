## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in this project, please follow responsible disclosure practices:

### For OSJKIT Template Issues
1. **Do NOT** open a public issue for security vulnerabilities
2. Email the maintainer directly (if available) or open a private security advisory
3. Include detailed information about the vulnerability
4. Allow time for the issue to be addressed before public disclosure

### For Your Application
When using this template for your own applications:

1. **Keep dependencies updated** - Regularly update npm packages
2. **Environment Variables** - Never commit sensitive data like API keys
3. **Input Validation** - Always validate user inputs
4. **HTTPS** - Use HTTPS in production
5. **Content Security Policy** - Implement CSP headers

## Security Best Practices

### Development
- Use the provided `.env.example` as a template for environment variables
- Never commit `.env.local` or `.env.production` files
- Regularly audit dependencies with `npm audit`
- Use the latest stable versions of React and other dependencies

### API Security
- Validate all API responses
- Implement proper error handling that doesn't expose sensitive information
- Use HTTPS for all API communications
- Implement rate limiting for API calls

### Build Security
- Ensure production builds don't include development tools
- Minimize bundle size to reduce attack surface
- Use proper build configurations for production

## Dependencies

This template includes security-focused configurations:
- ESLint for code quality and security patterns
- Updated dependencies with known security fixes
- Proper .gitignore to prevent sensitive file commits

## Questions?

For non-security related questions, please open a regular issue.
